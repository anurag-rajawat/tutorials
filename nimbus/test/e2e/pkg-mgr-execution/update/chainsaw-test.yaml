    This test validates the following:
    - If a SecurityIntent or SecurityIntentBinding is updated, Nimbus updates the
      corresponding NimbusPolicy. The Nimbus adapter then updates the corresponding
      policies accordingly.

    - If an adapter policy is manually altered for any reason, those changes are
      discarded.
