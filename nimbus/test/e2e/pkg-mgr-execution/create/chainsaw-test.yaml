    This test validates when a SecurityIntent and SecurityIntentBinding are
    created, Nimbus generates a corresponding NimbusPolicy. Subsequently, the
    Nimbus adapter translates this NimbusPolicy into concrete policy rules to
    create the necessary policies.

  steps:
    - name: Create PacakgeManagerExecution SecurityIntent and SecurityIntentBinding
      try:
        - apply:
            file: ../../../controller/manifest/security-intent.yaml
        - apply:
            file: ../../../controller/manifest/security-intent-binding.yaml

    - name: Assert SecurityIntentBinding's status subresource
      try:
        - assert:
            file: ../sib-status.yaml

    - name: Assert NimbusPolicy creation
      try:
        - assert:
            file: ../nimbus-policy.yaml

    - name: Assert KubeArmor policy creation
      try:
        - assert:
            file: ../ksp.yaml

    - name: Assert NimbusPolicy's status subresource
      description: |
        Verify the NimbusPolicy's status subresource includes the number and names of
        created security engine policies.
      try:
        - assert:
            file: ../np-status.yaml
