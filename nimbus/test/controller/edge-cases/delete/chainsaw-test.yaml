    This test verifies that if a SecurityIntent is the only one referenced in a SecurityIntentBinding, and that
    SecurityIntent is deleted, the related NimbusPolicy is also automatically deleted.

  steps:
    - name: Create a SecurityIntent
      try:
        - apply:
            file: ../../manifest/security-intent.yaml

    - name: Create a SecurityIntentBinding
      try:
        - apply:
            file: ../../manifest/security-intent-binding.yaml

    - name: Assert NimbusPolicy creation
      try:
        - assert:
            file: ../nimbus-policy-to-assert.yaml

    - name: Delete referenced created SecurityIntent
      try:
        - delete:
            file: ../../manifest/security-intent.yaml

    - name: Assert NimbusPolicy deletion
      try:
        - script:
            content: kubectl get np package-mgrs-binding -n $NAMESPACE
            check:
              ($error != null): true

    - name: Assert SecurityIntentBinding's status subresource
      description: |
        Verify that the created SecurityIntentBinding's status subresource does not include the number
        and names of bound intents, and does not have a NimbusPolicy name.
      try:
        - assert:
            file: sib-status-after-si-deletion.yaml
