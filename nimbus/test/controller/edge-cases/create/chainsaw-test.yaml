  description: |
    This test verifies the independent creation of SecurityIntent and SecurityIntentBinding custom resources.
    To make sure we can create these custom resources without needing another one to exist first.

  steps:
    - name: Create a SecurityIntentBinding
      try:
        - apply:
            file: ../../manifest/security-intent-binding.yaml

    - name: Create a SecurityIntent
      try:
        - apply:
            file: ../../manifest/security-intent.yaml

    - name: Assert NimbusPolicy creation
      try:
        - assert:
            file: ../nimbus-policy-to-assert.yaml

    - name: Assert SecurityIntentBinding's status subresource
      description: |
        Verify the created SecurityIntentBinding status subresource includes the number and names of bound intents, 
        along with the generated NimbusPolicy name.
      try:
        - assert:
            file: ../sib-status-to-assert.yaml
